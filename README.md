# RECOORD-database
RECOORD is a recalculated coordinate database of over 500 proteins from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using state-of-the-art methods based on CNS and CYANA1. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structures of these proteins were recalculated, and curated restraints were obtained from the BioMagResBank FRED database.
