# RECOORD-database
RECOORD is a recalculated coordinate database of over 500 proteins from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using state-of-the-art methods based on CNS and CYANA1. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structures of these proteins were recalculated, and curated restraints were obtained from the BioMagResBank FRED database.

I attempted to upload the RECOORD database; however, due to its large size, I was unable to complete the upload process. If you kindly contact me at yycho@kribb.re.kr, I can arrange to share it using methods such as SCP or other suitable alternatives. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
